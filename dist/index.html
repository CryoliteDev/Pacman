          Hit start to get the game started! You play as Pacman, and your
          objective is to eat all the dots. Standing in your way are the four
          ghosts. Being caught by one of these ghosts will lead to your demise
          so try to avoid it!
        </p>
        <p>
          To help against the ghosts, there are four powerpills scattered around
          the map. Once you eat one, Pacman wil be able to eat the ghosts.
          However once the effect runs out, you better make sure to avoid them
          again!
